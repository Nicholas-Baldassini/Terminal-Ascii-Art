# Terminal-Ascii-Art
Prints random ascii art into console along with a welcome message every time a new terminal is opened

Written in Bash, ascii art from http://artscene.textfiles.com/asciiart/

Tested on macOS only.

Note this is just the script, to get the script to run everytime you create a new terminal simply add bootArt.sh to ~.zshrc or ~.bashrc
depending on if your running macOS or linux.

Edit the last line with "vim bootArt.sh" to add your own custom message, currently it is a default message.
